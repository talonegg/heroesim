# Decision log

Significant decisions taken during the build, recorded before or alongside implementation.
Append a new entry; never edit an accepted one — supersede it with a later entry that names it.
Every entry says who decided: the owner, or an agent when the epic left a choice open or a
genuine contradiction forced one. Architecture decisions taken during the design session live in
[`./adr/`](./adr/) and are not repeated here.

Format (from DL-215, held by `npm test`; DL-219): `## DL-nn — title`, then
- a line `**Status:** … · **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Decided by:** …`;
- **Context.**, why a decision was needed;
- **Decision.**, in numbered items;
- *Judgement calls, for the owner to see*, where an agent chose what was left open;
- **Consequences.**;
- **Evidence.**, a few lines naming the commits, the reports, the checks and the epic's boxes.

An entry is at most 6 KB. Checks with their counts, mutation runs, the doctor's readings, sweep
figures and a verification's findings go in the commit messages and the harness's reports, which the
Evidence names. An entry before DL-215 is as it was written.

**Where the entries are** (DL-215). This file holds the open release's entries, and a new entry is
appended at its end. Every earlier entry is in [`./decisions/archive/`](./decisions/archive/), one
file per release, and the Pre-M0 review decisions are in
[`./decisions/archive/pre-m0-review.md`](./decisions/archive/pre-m0-review.md). At a release's
close its entries move to an archive file of their own, `DL-<first>-<last>-<release>.md`, with the
text unchanged.

- *An item superseded in full* is a one-line stub in its entry, naming the entry that superseded it.
  Its text is in [`./decisions/archive/superseded/`](./decisions/archive/superseded/), in a file
  named for its entry.
- *An item superseded in part* keeps its text, with a note beneath it. The same file in
  `superseded/` records what superseded it.
- *When a new entry supersedes an earlier item,* the same commit writes the stub or the note and the
  record in `superseded/`. These, a move with the text unchanged, and a dated note are the only
  changes made to an accepted entry.

[`./decisions/index.md`](./decisions/index.md) lists every entry: its date, its title, what
superseded it and the file that holds it. `npm run decisions -- index` writes it after an entry is
added, moved or superseded. `npm test` fails when it is stale, or when a `DL-nn` cited anywhere in
the repository is no entry. To read an entry, find its file in the index, then search the file for
`## DL-nn `.

## DL-255 — A merge of docs, records and the release pipeline alone releases nothing: no tag, no deploy

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-10-10 · **Decided by:** the owner, answering on 2026-10-10
"record-only merges": (c) change the pipeline, by rule (a); how it is built by the agent, marked
below

**Context.** After v1.1.9 was released and recorded, `v1.1-release` was fast-forwarded to its
record, and CI opened #62, "Release v1.1.10 from v1.1-release", holding only docs and records.
Every merge into `main` released its line's next patch (DL-124 item 3), so merging the record would
have tagged and deployed v1.1.10, a tree no player could tell from v1.1.9. The owner wants #62
merged with no new tag, v1.1.9 staying the release.

**Decision.**

1. **The rule** (the owner's). A merge into `main` releases nothing (no tag, no deploy, no GitHub
   Release) when every path that differs between the newest release tag and the merge's tree lies
   in `docs/`, `harness/reports/` or `.github/`, is a Markdown file (`*.md`), or is
   `web/scripts/release.mjs` or its test. Anything else releases as before.
2. **The judgement.** `isRecordOnly(paths)` in `web/scripts/release.mjs` applies the rule, and
   `release.mjs record <commit> [base]` prints `record` or `release`, the base by default the newest
   release tag. It reads `git diff --name-only --no-renames -z`, so a rename counts both its paths.
   With no release tag it prints `release`; a git failure fails the step.
3. **The pull request.** `release-pr.yml`, when the branch's tip is a record, titles its pull request
   "Record from `<branch>` (no release)", with a body saying its merge releases nothing, and edits an
   open one's title and body alike. Otherwise it is unchanged.
4. **The merge.** `release.yml` keeps every refusal: one merged pull request, its tree the merge's,
   and `next`'s refusal of a branch that is no release branch or an older line's. A merge its tag
   already marks is deployed again, as before. Then, for a record, it makes no tag, writes the
   output `tag` empty and says so in the run's summary; the `deploy` job runs only when `tag` is not
   empty, and no tag is pushed, so `deploy.yml` is not reached.
5. **The docs.** `docs/deploy.md` says when a merge is a record, and the README's line says
   merging releases unless it holds records alone.

*Judgement calls, for the owner to see:*
- **`release.d.mts` counts as `release.mjs`.** The function's type is declared there for web's
  typecheck; without it #62, which carries this change, would release. It ships nothing.
- **The workflow's tests are in `release.test.ts`**, not beside DL-124's in `deploy.test.ts`, which
  is not a record path: adding them there would make this change release.
- **No change is a record.** A merge whose tree is the newest release's makes no tag; before, it
  made a new tag of the same tree.
- **The base is the newest release tag, not the last record** (26cd276 was v1.1.8's): the tag's tree
  is production's, and what differs from it is what a merge would deploy. Records merged after a
  release are judged against it again, so the first merge that changes anything else releases them
  all with it.
- **`*.md` is matched by its lower-case ending**, anywhere; a case that does not match releases.

**Consequences.** #62, once this is pushed to `v1.1-release`, is retitled "Record from
v1.1-release (no release)"; merging it moves `main` and leaves v1.1.9 the newest tag and production.
A record's merge still runs `check` on its push to the release branch. A change to `.github/` alone
deploys nothing, so a workflow's change is first exercised by the next release.

**Evidence.** The commit `v1.1.9 (DL-255)`, whose message holds the checks and the dry runs on this
repository.
Verified 2026-10-10 at 4a3d70f: 21 mutations red (one survivor closed by a test), and a scratch repository's tag, record merges and code merge dry-run through both workflows' blocks, found item 2's "a git failure fails the step" untrue (inside `[ "$(...)" = record ]` a failing judgement fell through to tagging and deploying), so both workflows now take the verdict as a statement of their own, test first; added a test that the base is the newest tag by number, and the record's pull request to delivery.md.
