# Heroesim

A guild-management simulation. You are a Guildmaster running a Guild of Heroes: take Quests
from Patrons, choose who to send, and grow the Heroes and the Guild over the years. The engine
is mechanical first; story-rich modules such as Campaigns and Scenarios come later.

Nothing is built yet — this is design v2, baselined 2026-09-24.

- [`CONTEXT.md`](./CONTEXT.md) — the glossary, and the words not to use
- [`docs/requirements.md`](./docs/requirements.md) — what the game is, the first build, and what is deferred
- [`docs/principles.md`](./docs/principles.md) — the design principles and what goes wrong without each
- [`docs/approach.md`](./docs/approach.md) — architecture, Turn pipeline, layout, build order, verification
- [`docs/data-model.md`](./docs/data-model.md) — the World State document: sections, tables, rules, validator
- [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/) — the decisions that are hard to reverse, and why
- [`docs/images/`](./docs/images/) — the conceptual game-flow diagram this baseline was drawn from

The v1 design and its proof of concept remain in history: the design at commit `059b645`, the
built game on branch `feature/poc`. v2 starts clean; nothing from v1 is assumed.
